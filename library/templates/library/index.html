      This library was the brainchild of Mrs. Anna Kataka, the then Foreign secretary of education. Together with her husband, funded this institution
      with aim of providing education for all. Many thanks.

      They say "education is the key to life " and whoever gets it opens vast financial opportunities and general life encounters. Invest in knowledge
      for a stable future.
